That\u{2019}s why paying $150 for a night at one hotel might be a rip off, but it could be a great deal somewhere else \u{2014} and that, in turn, is why <a href=\"http://www.dealangel.com\">DealAngel</a> is launching a new way to search for hotels.</p>\n<p>When you go to the DealAngel site and select your dates, it provides a list of hotels and prices for your trip. Each of those rooms is assigned a \u{201c}value\u{201d} score \u{2014} basically, how the offered price compares to the expected market rate for the room. If a room on a given night would normally cost $300, and instead it\u{2019}s priced at $150, that\u{2019}s a great value \u{2014} but you might not see that if you\u{2019}re searching purely based on price.</p>\n<p>That \u{201c}market rate\u{201d} estimate for the room is based on pricing data from both that hotel and surrounding locations \u{2014} in fact, DealAngel says its algorithm looks at millions of data points across the Web. Co-founders Roman Peskin (the CEO) and Bob Rogers (the COO) bring different kinds of industry experience to the table \u{2014} Peskin managed revenue at a group of hotels in Prague, while Rogers worked at Expedia. Peskin says that with their experience, and the technology they\u{2019}ve developed, searching for hotel rooms on DealAngel is like playing the slot machines in Vegas while the slot machine maker looks over your shoulder and gives you advice.</p>\n<p>The real question, ultimately, is: How much do consumers care? If you find a cheap, decent hotel, do you really care if it\u{2019}s a great \u{201c}value\u{201d}? Conversely, are you going to want to stay at a hotel that costs $50 more per night because of that value?</p>\n<p>\u{201c}Who doesn\u{2019}t like staying in a five-star hotel for the price of a three-star hotel?\u{201d} Peskin counters.</p>\n<p>He also points to the success of companies like Groupon as a sign that people aren\u{2019}t just looking for the lowest price, but also the best deal. (And even though there are hotel deals on Groupon, Peskin says it can be a challenge to apply those deals to the dates you want \u{2014} not a problem at DealAngel, where you\u{2019}re reserving a room for a specific night.)</p>\n<p>Peskin and Rogers first built a market intelligence product for hotels, but they decided that they had a bigger opportunity turning that technology into a consumer product. DealAngel is launching this week at DEMO, the technology conference co-produced by VentureBeat (my old employer). The company has raised a seed round of less than $500,000 from Foresight Ventures.</p>\n  <br><div class=\"module-crunchbase\">\n   \t<div class=\"configuration-neighbor\">\n       <h2 class=\"global-module-header-default\">\n   \t\t\t<span class=\"line-2\">\n   \t\t\t  <div class=\"cb-home-header cb-stack-home-header\">\n   \t\t\t    <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com\">Crunchbase</a>\n   \t\t\t  </div>\n   \t\t\t</span>\n   \t\t</h2>\n   \t\t<div class=\"container\">\n     \t\t<ul class=\"tab-container\">\n<li><a class=\"tab item-1 current\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"s_objectID='post_widget_crunchbase';\">DEALANGEL</a></li>\n    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\t<li><a class=\"tab item-2\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"s_objectID='post_widget_crunchbase';\">FORESIGHT VENTURES</a></li>\n    \t\t\t  \t\t\t</ul>\n<div class=\"panel-container\">\n            \t\t\t\t<div class=\"panel item-1 current\">\n   \t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"leftgreen\">\n   \t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"info-container info-container-stack-view\">\n     \t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"left-align\">\n     \t\t\t\t\t\t  <span class=\"header-text\">Company:</span>\n     \t\t\t\t\t\t  <span><a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/innjet\" onclick=\"s_objectID='post_widget_crunchbase';\">DealAngel</a></span>\n     \t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"left-align\">\n     \t\t\t\t\t\t  <span class=\"header-text\">Website:</span>\n     \t\t\t\t\t\t  <span><a href=\"http://www.dealangel.com\" onclick=\"s_objectID='post_widget_crunchbase';\">dealangel.com</a></span>\n     \t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \t\t\t\t\t\t                     <div class=\"left-align\">\n                       <span class=\"header-text\">Launch Date:</span>\n                       <span>August 2011</span>\n                     </div>\n                                           \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n   \t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"body-copy\">\n                 <p>DealAngel.com is a highly visual travel deal search engine with powerful analytical elements that makes finding great travel deals easier, more effective, and more fun.

Like all game companies, we make occasional adjustments to resize teams as projects are completed and new priorities are established. Overall, we expect that headcount will be up at the end of this year.\u{201d}</p>\n<p>Our sources indicate that the layoffs will be closer to 500 and are tied to the company\u{2019}s game schedule. Last year, the company shipped two epic projects: Battlefield 3 and Star Wars: The Old Republic, which were challenging Activision\u{2019}s respective dominance in first-person shooters and massively multiplayer online categories.</p>\n<p>Once a title shifts, some employees stay on to work on other projects or remain on teams that build new content for the existing games to keep them fresh.</p>\n<p>In this case, it appears the cuts show just how many resources the company was investing in these titles before launch. We expect to hear about these titles\u{2019} performance in a couple weeks when EA reports fourth-quarter earnings.</p>\n<p>Three years ago, the company conducted a larger\u{a0}<a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20091109/electronic-arts-to-sack-1500/\">restructuring, totaling</a>\u{a0}1,500 employees.</p>\n<p>Still, the Redwood City, Calif., company has aggressive hiring plans.\u{a0}Previously, it disclosed\u{a0}it wants to hire 5,000 engineers by the end of the decade to help build a platform, crossing all of its labels, including mobile, social and console. In particular, CTO Rajat Taneja has been bulking up his team since joining EA in October and now has 600 people on staff.</p>\n<p>In afternoon trading, EA\u{2019}s stock was down more than 5 percent, or 89 cents, to trade at $15.29 a share. Over the past year, it has traded as high as $26 a share.</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n\t",

The Japanese company took its latest blow today when former chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa was arrested in Tokyo on suspicion of having falsified financial statements. The Tokyo prosecutor's office released a statement saying that two other former execs were also brought into police custody, including Hisashi Mori, a former executive vice president, and Hideo Yamada, a former auditor. Olympus is also faced with the possibility of being delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange -- the decision has been deferred awaiting further evidence. So what does all this mean for the scandal-ridden camera maker's position in the industry? Little, perhaps, from a consumer perspective, considering that Olympus has continued to announce and ship new products, including the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/02/07/olympus-om-d-e-m5-micro-four-thirds-camera-preview-video/\">well-received EM-5</a>.

For starters, a <a href=\"http://mashable.com/category/google/\">Google</a> bomb isn’t as sudden and life-threatening as it sounds. Some of these bombs can actually take months to execute. </p>\n<p>And there are several kinds of Google bomb. The most well-known tactic involves linking a specific term to a specific site as many times as possible all over the Internet. For instance, say you had a completely irrational hatred for man sandals (true story), and you were making it your life’s mission to tarnish the “mandal” industry. You would link the phrase “Mandals are ogre shoes” to a site like <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mandals\" target=\"_blank\">Urban Dictionary’s definition for mandals</a>. And you would copy/paste the heck out of that linked phrase — all over the web. </p>\n<p>Soon, presumably, you would have associated the definition of mandals with the term “ogre shoes” so many times that a Google search for “ogre shoes” would bring up the Urban Dictionary mandal page in search results. (Fun fact: A current search for the phrase “ogre shoes” brings up about 2 million results. Go figure.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2012/04/13/googles-growth-infographic/\">Google’s Amazing Growth, By The Numbers [INFOGRAPHIC]</a></strong></center>\n<p>Google bombs were originally known as “search engine bombs” before Google became the ubiquitous, default term for online search. That should signify that these “bombs” have been around for quite some time, the first dating back to 1999. </p>\n<p>They’ve been used in political campaigns to associate a negative word or phrase with certain politicians. They’ve even been employed to accompany Internet memes like Chuck Norris.

And the story holds lessons for budding online entrepreneurs, too. How did all this happen?</p>\n\t\t \n\t\n\n        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Last year, Monroy was just another nine-year-old kid from East Los Angeles trying to figure out what to do with his summer, when one day he went to his dad's auto parts store. The store was largely devoid of customers, as Dad does most of his business online. Caine asked if he could play with the cardboard boxes that the parts came in, and before you could say \"Zoltar,\" he had constructed his own cardboard replica of several arcade-style games, such as miniature pop-shot basketball and ring toss. He then proceeded to sit in the store and wait for customers to play at his arcade.</p>\n\n<p>There weren't many since foot traffic to the store was sparse. One day, Mullick happened to stop by and became entranced. He bought Caine's premium \"Fun Pass\" and started coming back for more games. He thought about a way to market the arcade and put together a flash mob meet-up at the auto parts store, along with a short 10-minute documentary video. The rest is thanks to the Internet and a lot of people. You can watch the movie here:</p>\n\n<p><iframe width=\"600\" height=\"379\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/faIFNkdq96U\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n\n<p>In the video, you'll note that Caine has implemented a sophisticated algorithm to ensure that his \"Fun Pass\" tickets are authentic, using the square root function of a pocket calculator. You've got to hand it to the kid. He has plenty of pluck. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://CainesArcade.com\">Mullick started a scholarship fund</a>, which has already topped $175,000 and is still growing. And that doesn't include a matching grant from the Goldhirsh Foundation. Caine also has a Facebook fan page with 100,000 fans and a Twitter account with more than 6,000 followers. To give his arcade an element of authenticity, Caine made his own special logo T-shirt and is now selling it on the site. The movie even has a theme song that you can download from iTunes (and it's another way to support the fund). </p>\n\n<p>Plenty of media outlets have given Caine coverage, including today's New York Times and dozens of TV stations. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2012/04/16/9-hidden-factors-of-caines-arcade-success/\">Forbes did a story earlier this week</a> that details nine factors of Caine and Mullick's success that other entrepreneurs should review. TJ McCue writes, \"There is a certain allure in American entrepreneur circles for turning waste in[to] wonder, of finding a diamond in the rough, so to speak.\" Another <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/calebmelby/2012/04/12/9-reasons-why-the-9-year-old-founder-of-caines-arcade-will-be-a-billionaire-in-30-years/\">Forbes columnist thinks Caine will be a billionaire in 30 years.</a> Certainly, his star is rising. Another meme is born.</p>\n\n<p>But more than a meme is what startups can learn from this experience: Just because you only have one customer doesn't mean you aren't in business, and you should treat every customer as carefully as Caine did. The care he took in realizing his vision is extraordinary, especially for someone so young. And understanding the power of just one person to leverage various social media is also key. </p>\n\n<p>So if you are an entrepreneur looking for inspiration today, check out the short video and read up on Caine's Arcade. It should get you thinking on how you too can create something from your own passion, even if you are just nine years old. </p>\n\n<p>As the lyrics to the theme song say, \"It's the best cardboard arcade that has ever been made.\" And that is something to which we can all aspire.</p>\n\t\t \n\t\n  ",

    assert_equal("\r\n\tWith <a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/show/5719/ocz-vertex-4-review-256gb-512gb\">OCZ intent on moving as much volume to its in-house Indilinx controllers as possible</a>, SandForce (<a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/show/5039/the-lsi-sandforce-acquisition-anands-thoughts\">now LSI</a>) needed to expand to additional partners. OCZ has strong control over the channel so SandForce needed to turn to multiple partners to diversify its portfolio. One key win for SandForce was Kingston. We saw the launch of the first Kingston SandForce (SF-2281) based drive last year under the HyperX brand. Today Kingston is announcing a lower cost version of the drive with the HyperX 3K.\r\n\t<a href=\"http://images.anandtech.com/reviews/storage/kingston/HyperX3K/_DSC0784.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"399\" src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/reviews/storage/kingston/HyperX3K/_DSC0784sm.jpg\" width=\"600\"></a><br><em>Kingston's HyperX 3K (top) vs. Kingston's HyperX (bottom)</em>\r\n\tThe 3K in this case refers to the number of program/erase cycles the NAND inside the SSD is rated for. As we've discussed on <a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/show/2738/5\">numerous</a> <a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/show/2829/2\">occasions</a>, NAND endurance is a finite thing. The process of programming a NAND cell is physically destructive to the cell itself and over time you'll end up with NAND that can no longer hold a charge (or your data).\r\n\tIntel's 50nm MLC NAND was rated for 10,000 program/erase cycles. Smaller transistor geometries, although tempting from a cost/capacity standpoint, do come with a reduction in program endurance. At 34nm Intel saw its p/e count drop to 5,000 cycles, and at 25nm we saw a range from 3,000 - 5,000. Modern day SSD controllers include wear leveling logic to ensure that all cells are written to evenly, so even at the lower end of the Intel 25nm range there's more than enough lifespan for a typical client workload. Let's do some math on a hypothetical 100GB drive with four different types of NAND (3K, 5K, 10K and 30K P/E cycles):\r\n\tAssuming you write 10GB to your drive every day (on the high end for most client workloads), and your workload is such that the controller sees an effective write amplification of 10x (due to wear leveling/garbage collection the controller has to write 10x the amount of data to NAND that you write to host), you'll blow through one p/e cycle per day. For 25nm 3K p/e cycle NAND that works out to be 8.219 years, at which point your data will remain intact (but presumably read-only) for 12 months. Heavier workloads come with higher write amplification factors, but for client use this math works out quite well.\r\n\tNAND is binned similar to CPUs, except instead of binning for clock speed and power NAND is binned for endurance. Intel offers both 3K and 5K rated 25nm NAND (among others, including ~30K p/e cycle eMLC NAND). The standard HyperX drive ships with 5K 25nm Intel MLC NAND, while the HyperX 3K ships with 3K 25nm Intel MLC NAND.\r\n\t<a href=\"http://images.anandtech.com/reviews/storage/kingston/HyperX3K/_DSC0779.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"406\" src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/reviews/storage/kingston/HyperX3K/_DSC0779sm.jpg\" width=\"600\"></a><br><em>Kingston's HyperX 3K 240GB</em>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://images.anandtech.com/reviews/storage/kingston/HyperX3K/_DSC0780.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/reviews/storage/kingston/HyperX3K/_DSC0780sm.jpg\" width=\"600\"></a>\r\n\tThere's no obvious difference in Intel's part numbers, so I'm not sure if there's a good way to tell whether you're looking at 3K or 5K rated parts from Intel.\r\n\tThe loss of endurance shouldn't matter for most client workloads as I mentioned above, but if you're deploying these drives in a write heavy enterprise environment I'd look elsewhere. Otherwise, the cost savings are worth it:\r\n\tHyperX 3K drives are already available via Newegg. The biggest cost savings appear to be at the 480GB capacity, although you'll save a good $10 - $20 for most capacities.\r\n\tKingston also offers an optional upgrade bundle kit including a handy screwdriver, SATA cable, USB cable, Acronis cloning software, SATA to USB adapter and a 3.5\" sled for mounting in a desktop case. It's a nice bundle although I really wish we'd see better 3.5\" adapters in these kits. The bundle will set you back another $10 over the prices in the table above.\r\n\t<a href=\"http://images.anandtech.com/reviews/storage/kingston/HyperX3K/_DSC0785.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"342\" src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/reviews/storage/kingston/HyperX3K/_DSC0785sm.jpg\" width=\"600\"></a>\r\n\tLike many SandForce partners, Kingston offers a toolbox to view SMART data however you cannot secure erase the drive from the utility. A separate utility is offered to handle firmware updates.\r\n\tWith Kingston's latest performance is, thankfully, unharmed. The HyperX 3K performs just as well as the 5K rated HyperX drive:\r\n\t<img alt=\"Heavy Workload 2011 - Average Data Rate\" src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph5734/45534.png\">\r\n\t<img alt=\"Light Workload 2011 - Average Data Rate\" src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph5734/45540.png\">\r\n\tKingston's SF-2281 implementation has always been extremely fast and the HyperX 3K is no exception. You are looking at one of the fastest drives we've ever tested. I've included our usual benchmarks in the subsequent pages but you can also use <a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/bench/ssd\">Bench</a> to compare drives directly.\r\n\tThe risk, as always, with SandForce based drives is that you'll run into a combination of drive + system that triggers either an incompatibility or the infamous BSOD issue. I haven't seen the bug crop up on the HyperX 3K but I haven't spent a lot of time looking for it either.\r\n\t<a href=\"http://images.anandtech.com/reviews/storage/kingston/HyperX3K/_DSC0781.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"397\" src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/reviews/storage/kingston/HyperX3K/_DSC0781sm.jpg\" width=\"600\"></a>\r\n\tAll I can offer is the same caution we tack onto most of our SSD reviews. If you know someone with a system similar (identical?) to yours who isn't running into problems then you'll probably be fine.\r\n\tIf you've had a good experience with the HyperX in a system, then the HyperX 3K is a no-brainer. You get similar, already great, performance at a lower cost.",

But today, as the future shifts toward mobile devices, things are not looking good for Microsoft. It's not that it's not trying: Microsoft is spending a lot of money and effort on cracking the mobile market, now in lockstep with <a class=\"hidden_link\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/nokia\">Nokia</a>, its top partner. But there's no indication yet that it's having any real success.\r\n<div id=\"more\" class=\"asset-more\">\r\n<h2>Losing Users</h2>\r\n<p>One troubling sign: Even now, more than a year after Microsoft started shipping <a class=\"hidden_link\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/windows-phone-7\">Windows Phone 7</a> devices, U.S. mobile customers are getting rid of Microsoft devices faster than they're buying new ones.</p>\r\n<p>In the three months <a href=\"http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2012/4/comScore_Reports_February_2012_U.S._Mobile_Subscriber_Market_Share\">ending in February</a>, Microsoft's share of U.S. smartphone subscribers was 3.9%, according to comScore. That's down from 5.2% last November and <a href=\"http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2011/4/comScore_Reports_February_2011_U.S._Mobile_Subscriber_Market_Share\">7.7%</a> last February.</p>\r\n<p>Longer term, Microsoft's share has been in a freefall: comScore had it at 18% at the end of 2009, and 36% in late 2007, the year <a class=\"hidden_link\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/apple\">Apple</a> introduced the <a class=\"hidden_link\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/iphone\">iPhone</a>. (See chart above.) Since then, Apple and <a class=\"hidden_link\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/google\">Google</a> have gobbled up the lion's share of the smartphone market, with more than 80% of U.S. smartphones in comScore's <a href=\"http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2012/4/comScore_Reports_February_2012_U.S._Mobile_Subscriber_Market_Share\">latest stats</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The trouble is that Microsoft's phones - though decent - just aren't good enough to demand attention. They're certainly better now than they used to be - especially the <a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/review_nokia_lumia_900.php\">new Lumia series from Nokia</a> - but that isn't enough. To cause any real damage to Apple or Google, Microsoft's phones would have to be <em>dramatically better</em> than the competition, and they just aren't.</p>\r\n<p>When <a class=\"hidden_link\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/steve-jobs\">Steve Jobs</a> described the iPhone as \"a leapfrog product that is WAY smarter than any mobile device has ever been,\" he wasn't just bragging. The iPhone completely changed the mobile industry in one day. Microsoft and its partners just aren't changing anything or making anyone nervous.</p>\r\n<h2>How To Win</h2>\r\n<p>There are two ways to succeed in today's smartphone market. You can either make a truly amazing product that wows consumers and gets them to seek it out by name - the iPhone way.</p>\r\n<p>Or you can become the next-best thing: Something that the mobile carriers can tweak to their liking and shove in peoples' faces, and sell phones that way.</p>\r\n<p>Operators still control a huge part of smartphone distribution, and that's how many (most?) <a class=\"hidden_link\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/android\">Android</a> devices have been sold: as alternatives to people who either can't or won't buy an iPhone, based on their carrier choice or other logic. Recall that Android didn't really take off in the U.S. until <a class=\"hidden_link\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/verizon\">Verizon</a> needed to produce the <a class=\"hidden_link\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/droid\">Droid</a> series as its iPhone alternative.</p>\r\n<p>Microsoft hasn't done either of these. The new <a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/review_nokia_lumia_900.php\">Nokia Lumia 900 is nice enough</a>, but no one's lining up <em>en masse</em> to ditch their iPhone for it. And you don't hear anything from AT&amp;T or any other carrier about Windows Phones becoming their best-selling devices, either.</p>\r\n<p>Sure, operators like Verizon Wireless <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57416405-94/will-verizon-throw-its-weight-behind-windows-phone/\">may <em>say</em> they want Windows</a> to succeed as an alternative to Apple and Google - <em>of course</em> they'd like to see today's platform leaders, their suppliers, less powerful. But carriers don't seem to be <em>doing</em> anything to make that happen.</p>\r\n<p>There just isn't a real reason for people to buy Windows phones instead of iPhones, or even Android phones - features, design, price, services, anything. And until there is, the Windows phone platform isn't going to do well.</p>\r\n<h2>The Long Haul</h2>\r\n<p>The good news is that Microsoft has two things - money and patience - that could help it eventually succeed in mobile. (And mobile is too important to the future of technology for Microsoft to sit it out.) Windows wasn't a huge overnight hit, and it took the <a class=\"hidden_link\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/xbox\">Xbox</a> a long time to make any real money. <a class=\"hidden_link\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/bing\">Bing</a> still isn't <a href=\"http://www.splatf.com/2011/09/google-search-stuck/\">taking anything away</a> from Google in the search industry. Recall that before the iPhone came along, Symbian and <a class=\"hidden_link\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/palm-inc\">Palm</a> were considered smartphone leaders. Now they're both gone. <a class=\"hidden_link\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/things\">Things</a> can change rapidly in this world.</p>\r\n<p>In theory, the launch of Windows 8 later this year, and Microsoft's continued success with the Xbox, could be seen as possible inflection points for Windows phone. There <em>should</em> be some benefits to having a computer/console and mobile device running the same platform - Apple has exploited these, to an extent, with the Mac and <a class=\"hidden_link\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/ios\">iOS</a> devices, and maybe Microsoft will, too, eventually.</p>\r\n<p>But it will, again, have to be <em>so amazing</em> that people and/or carriers will really take notice and consciously switch their allegiance. And the odds of that happening, based on Microsoft's track record in mobile, are slim. If, in a year, we're still looking at mid-single-digit market share stats for Windows Phone, Microsoft will have to do something <em>more</em> dramatic and/or expensive to matter in mobile. And even then, it might be too late or might not work.</p>\r\n<p>But for now, this comeback is not looking great.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Also: <a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_end_of_rim_as_we_know_it.php\">The End of RIM As We Know It</a></strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"related-entries\">\r\n<h3>See Also</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"bullet\">\n<li class=\"widget-list-item\"><a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_official_guide_to_google_drive.php\">The Google Drive Review You've Been Waiting For</a></li>\r\n<li class=\"widget-list-item\"><a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/5_things_to_look_for_during_apples_earnings_today.php\">5 Things to Look for During Apple's Earnings Today</a></li>\r\n<li class=\"widget-list-item\"><a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/7_extremely_weird_mobile_apps_for_your_iphone_and.php\">7 Extremely Weird Apps for Your iPhone and Android</a></li>\r\n<li class=\"widget-list-item\"><a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/intels_new_ivy_bridge_more_power_in_less_chip.php\">Intel's New Ivy Bridge: More Power in Less Chip</a></li>\r\n<li class=\"widget-list-item\"><a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/can_anonymous_fix_online_music.php\">Can Anonymous Fix Online Music?</a></li>\r\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p class=\"tagline\">This story was originally published by <a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ReadWriteWeb</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

The HTC One X variant is up for preorder on May 7th, with Sprint claiming a release would come shortly thereafter. The EVO 4G LTE will run $199.99 with new two year agreement, continuing Sprint’s insistence on $200 as the ideal high-end smartphone price.</p>\n<h2>The Rumor</h2>\n<p>Sprint will release the EVO 4G LTE on May 18th both online and in Sprint’s retail stores. Today’s rumor serves as further evidence of a May 18th date, <a href=\"http://www.phonedog.com/2012/04/18/rumor-htc-evo-4g-lte-hitting-sprint-on-may-18th/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.phonedog.com']);\">after a PhoneDog rumor</a> last week.</p>\n<h2>The Source</h2>\n<p>This rumor comes from an anonymous source inside Sprint, who for obvious reasons wishes to remain nameless. This source has proven reliable in the past, pinpointing the release date for the Sprint Galaxy Nexus, and I find this source to be trustworthy.</p>\n<h2>One Android Insider’s take on the rumor</h2>\n<p>With preorders of the HTC EVO 4G LTE set to begin on May 7th, May 18th seems just about as good a date as any for the follow up to the highly popular EVO line, and goes along with a previous <em>PhoneDog</em> rumor from a separate source. That said, both the Galaxy Nexus and LG Viper were released on a Sunday, giving us just a bit of skepticism that Sprint would choose to launch the EVO 4G LTE on a Friday.</p>\n<p>Still, our source has provided us reliable information in the past, and we know that Sprint wants to get the EVO 4G LTE out as soon as possible. Unless we hear otherwise, we’re going to go ahead and pen the 18th in as the EVO’s release date, and you probably should too.</p>\n<p>Who’s planning on picking up the EVO 4G LTE when it launches next month?</p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n/* <![CDATA[ */\n\t\tvar entity_decoded_nr_mp_url = jQuery('<span/>').html(\"http://api.nrelate.com/mpw_wp/0.51.1/loadcounter.php?tag=nrelate_popular&domain=androidandme.com&url=http%3A%2F%2Fandroidandme.com%2F2012%2F04%2Fsmartphones-2%2Frumor-sprint-htc-evo-4g-lte-to-be-released-may-18th%2F\").text();\n\t\tnRelate.getNrelatePosts(entity_decoded_nr_mp_url);\n/* ]]&gt; */\n</script>",

Instead, it plans to reposition the older 4G technology as the network for its prepaid customers. Sprint will begin selling WiMAX devices next quarter under the Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile brands, network operations president Steve Elfman said Wednesday on <a href=\"http://investors.sprint.com/CorporateProfile.aspx?iid=4057219\">Sprint’s first quarter earnings call</a>.</p>\n<p>The strategy makes perfect sense for Sprint, which is trying to sort through a growing number of network technologies. WiMAX powers all of its 4G smartphones and modems today, but Sprint is <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/mobile/why-youll-likely-see-sprint-lte-phones-sooner-than-later/\">already phasing out WiMAX devices</a> and <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/mobile/sprints-199-galaxy-nexus-lands-apr-22-with-50-in-wallet-credits/\">selling its first LTE smartphones</a> in preparation for <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/broadband/sprint-details-first-lte-launch-cities-expansion-plans/\">the new network’s launch this summer</a>. While it will continue to support existing WiMAX smartphones and device customers, it won’t add many new ones – at least not under the Sprint banner.</p>\n<p>Network partner Clearwire supplies Sprint’s WiMAX capacity but it only does so in a limited footprint, making it increasingly difficult for Sprint to pit its current 4G service against its competitors large and growing LTE and HSPA+ networks. Sprint, however, is Clearwire’s majority stakeholder and has committed to selling the wholesale mobile broadband carrier’s WiMAX and future LTE capacity for years to come. By shifting WiMAX over to Boost and Virgin, Sprint can deliver faster speeds to its growing prepaid base – it <a href=\"http://investors.sprint.com/Cache/1001165458.PDF?D=&amp;O=PDF&amp;IID=4057219&amp;Y=&amp;T=&amp;FID=1001165458\">added 489,000 net prepaid subscribers</a> in the first quarter – while keeping Clearwire afloat <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/broadband/will-clearwire-sprint-build-a-4g-monster-or-a-mouse/\">during its transition to LTE</a>.</p>\n<p>Moving prepaid data customers over to WiMAX also takes some of the burden off its 3G network in areas 4G is available.

The crew of The Hobbit have decided to attempt to work in 48 frames per second with the new film and have done a single public screening thus far this month at CinemaCon. Reactions to this new ultra-clear ultra-smooth version of filming and presenting of a film have not been positive on the whole, this not exactly becoming the instant win that Jackson and the rest of the Middle Earth family hoping it would be.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/asdfds.jpeg\" alt=\"\" title=\"asdfds\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224698\"></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-224697\"></span></p>\n<p>What’s appearing to happen with this newly upgraded system is that because there are so many frames of film being shown per second, the human eye says that it’s getting much to close to reality. While your eyes are trained to differentiate between reality and what you see presented to you in any number of different media presentations you see on the daily, new techniques like this one are blurring that line. When Peter Jackson and crew aimed to clarify the way we see films, it appears that they did not prepare themselves for the negativity that has come forth from the critics having first seen the film in this quick motion this month. </p>\n<p>While most modern films (essentially all of them, that is) are shot and projected at 24FPS, Jackson has for over a year now been pushing for a much higher frame rate on the regular. James Cameron also spoke last year, according to <a href=\"\" target=\"_Blank\">SlashFilm</a>, at CinemaCon the following:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“If watching a 3D movie is like looking through a window, then [with this] we’ve taken the glass out of the window and we’re staring at reality.” – Cameron</p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<center>\n<object classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" width=\"580\" height=\"361\" id=\"SGTV\" name=\"SGTV\">\r\n   <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://asset.slashgear.tv/sgplayer.swf\">\n<param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\">\n<param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\">\n<param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"config=http://asset.slashgear.tv/sgtv.php?vkey=28a7c1b49c63f1a55781\">\n<embed id=\"SGTV\" name=\"SGTV\" src=\"http://asset.slashgear.tv/sgplayer.swf\" width=\"580\" height=\"361\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" flashvars=\"config=http://asset.slashgear.tv/sgtv.php?vkey=28a7c1b49c63f1a55781\"></embed></object>\r\n</center>\n\n<p></p>\n<center><em>Hobbit teaser (in 24FPS)</em></center>\n<p>This year’s showing of a clip from The Hobbit in 48FPS has resulted in many speaking up about how the film looked “too real,” equating it with made for TV movies and the like.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Saw the 10 minutes of raw The Hobbit footage in 48FPS 3D. Intriguing, the footage looks amazing, but the 48FPS experience is an odd change” – <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/firstshowing\" target=\"_Blank\">Alex Billington</a> of First Showing</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>“Great Scott, THE HOBBIT in 48 frames-per-second is a thing to behold. Totally different experience. Not all will like the change.” – <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/Variety_JLD\" target=\"_Blank\">Josh Dickey</a> of Variety</p></blockquote>\n<p>We’ll now have to see if Jackson and the studios responsible for bringing the film to the theater will go forward with the film in such a format. It’s unclear at the moment whether or not they’ll have to make drastic changes to the way the film is presented now that the majority of the scenes for the movie have been filmed. </p>\n<p><strong>BONUS:</strong> We’ve got a <a href=\"http://www.slashgear.com/tags/3ality-technica/\" target=\"_blank\">3ality Technica</a> interview coming up this week on how The Hobbit was filmed with RED cameras – two of them at once – for every shot using 3ality Technica rigs to make the whole film HD 3D.

It literally made us nauseous, it looked so good. But that's nothing, as of right now: Panasonic just <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/04/27/panasonic-145-inch-8k-plasma-nhk-japan/\">dropped</a> a <em>145-inch</em> 7,680 x 4,320 mega-set.</p> <p>The plasma set is a prototype, of course, and the 8k technology itself is still many, many years from being anywhere near your living room. But even knowing this sort of thing exists is pretty spectacular—having gazed into it myself, I can tell you 8k is like looking out of a window. Jarringly so. 145 inches will probably never be practical for the home of anyone but the most palatially-housed, but it stands alone as a feat. And just imagine it in, say, a sports bar, or someplace that can actually accomodate a machine this absurdly large.</p> <p>Panasonic says making a set this mammoth without flicker was tough, but they pulled it off—and Japanese broadcaster NHK will be showing it off in public next month.
